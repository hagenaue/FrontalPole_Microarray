This code was primarily written by Liam Cannon Thew Forrester, with mentorship and guidance by Megan Hagenauer.

# Navigating the code:

This code focuses on the re-analysis and meta-analysis of public frontal pole (BA10) microarray data to accompany our qPCR analysis of neurotransmission-related gene expression in BA10 in subjects with Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia.

The two public datasets used were:
Gene Expression Omnibus #GSE1265420: n=50, CTRL: n=15, BPD: n=11, SCHIZ: n=13, MDD=11;
Gene Expression Omnibus #GSE1761221: n=51, CTRL: n=23, SCHIZ: n=28

The code was intended for single use, and is minimally annotated and occasionally non-linear (especially in areas of troubleshooting) or completely tangential to the primary goals of the project. Feel free to message me if you have questions.

The code for the qPCR analyses is found in a different repository: https://github.com/hagenaue/Adriana_FrontalPole
